# cybersecurity-projects
This collection of projects was developed during my internship at Prodigy InfoTech, focusing on practical implementations of encryption, password security, and system monitoring. These projects are not only hands-on, but theyâ€™re also designed with efficiency in mind, delivering straightforward solutions to key cybersecurity challenges.
